                It would be a really interesting and imaginative way to enhance the tours programme. I like the idea of weaving scannable voice recording almost like a treasure hunt around the city. A cool, 
                innovative project.”

    <p id="caption">The project is a street sticker that allows people to leave their voice on the streets. 
        The stickers contain an NFC chip (a microchip that reacts to a smartphone), 
        and users simply tap the sticker onto their smartphone, 
        enter their voice from the website and place the sticker on their favourite or memorable location. 
        The remaining stickers can similarly be played back with a tap on the smartphone to play back the voice. 
        Every sticker is also given a unique ID, allowing users to see on a map which sticker has the voice registered and where it has been left.
